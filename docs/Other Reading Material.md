There are a thousand ways that Knowledge Graphs, such as the ones *CanGraph* provides, can be explored. In this tutorial, we aim to provide a useful compilation of possible queries, ways of working, and forms of analyzing them, but this are in no way all the different ways meaningful insights can be extracted from each GraphML export *CanGraph* might provide. Neo4J is a vast software, and tons of other useful programs for graph manipulation exist, such as [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/) or [python itself](https://pypi.org/project/python-graph/). Neo4J even provides its own data visualization tool, [Neo4J Bloom](https://neo4j.com/product/bloom/), although it is not open source and might require a paid license.

We would thus like to recommend you the following, useful resources:

* [Neo4J's Graph Academy](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/) hosts a free knowledge base on the field of Graphs, which can serve as useful tutorials in case what is reflected here is too confusing or difficult to follow. In particular, I would recommend:
    * Their [Neo4j Fundamentals](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/) course for a primer on how graphs work and on Neo4J itself
    * Their [Cypher Fundamentals](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/cypher-fundamentals/) course, to expand on this tutorial and on outputs processing
    * Their [Building Neo4j Applications with Python](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/app-python/) course, in case you want to really dive into how CanGraph works and modify it according to your needs.

* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), which describes itself as "where developers learn, share & build careers" is a massive repository of questions and answers regarding all kinds of things in the informatics world. It is ikely that most of the questions you may have, or things you may want to use neo4j for, has been asked there already, so do not hesitate to search for more info or even ask there if you please.

Finally, in case you find any errors in this guides, or if you want to add any comments/suggestions, you may open an issue in our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/OMB-IARC/CanGraph). We look forward to any comments you may want to provide, and hope you have a fantastic experience using our software! :P
