CanGraph is a python program that allows you to extract information about a newly discovered or existing metabolite from the following databases:

<!-- Since emojis are not availaible in LaTeX, lets include them only in the Web build,
     replacing things for the LaTeX build-->

```{only} latex
* Human Metabolome DB
* DrugBank
* Exposome Explorer
* WikiData
* SMPDB
* MesH and MetaNetX
```

```

For this purpose, CanGraph accepts any of the following inputs:

* **InChI:** The International Chemical Identifier for the metabolite, which can be calculated using Open Source Software and identifies a metabolite with 99.99% accuracy based on its structure
* **InChIKey:** The Hashed, shortened version of the InChI, sometimes used for efficiency
* **Name:** A commonly accepted name for the metabolite; preferably, IUPAC's standarized name
* **HMDB_ID:** The Metabolite's Identifier in the Human Metabolome Database
* **ChEBI_ID:** The Metabolite's Identifier in the ChEBI Database

which must be provided as explained in [CanGraph's README](CanGraph.rst)
