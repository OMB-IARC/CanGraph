"""
A python module that prepares the local environment, to be able to run the :obj:`~CanGraph.main`
and :obj:`~CanGraph.deploy` functions. This can be either run in an interactive way, requiring
user input; or in a automatic way, in order to pre-configure things, for example, if you are using
the singularity package

CanGraph.setup Usage
---------------------

To use this module:

.. argparse::
   :module: CanGraph.setup
